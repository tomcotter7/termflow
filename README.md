# TERMFLOW

**Progress on tasks without leaving the terminal**

Inspired initially by clikan (and then later by my updates to clikan), I wanted to build something that replicated this functionality but that you didn't have to keep typing the name of the command. Therefore, I wanted to build a TUI application & that's what termflow is.
